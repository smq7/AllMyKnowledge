<!-- The action attribute defines where the data gets sent. Its value must be a valid relative 
or absolute URL. If this attribute isn't provided, the data will be sent to the URL of the
page containing the form — the current page.
<form action="https://example.com">…</form>
<form action="/somewhere_else">…</form>
The names and values of the non-file form controls are sent to the server as
name=value pairs joined with ampersands

How the data is sent depends on the method attribute. -->

<!-- 
GET
https://mdn.github.io/learning-area/html/forms/sending-form-data/get-method.html

Since the GET method has been used, you'll see the URL 
www.foo.com/?say=Hi&to=Mom appear in the browser address bar when you submit the form.

GET /?say=Hi&to=Mom HTTP/2.0
Host: foo.com -->

<!-- When the form is submitted using the POST method, you get no data appended to the URL,
and the HTTP request looks like so, with the data included in the request body instead:

POST / HTTP/2.0
Host: foo.com
Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded
Content-Length: 13

say=Hi&to=Mom
